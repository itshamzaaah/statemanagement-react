In this beginner project in react, the react hooks(useEffect, usestate) got practice. <br/>
What have be done in the project; <br/><br/>
1. I have done so far im holding the user data by using the state (usestate method) in the local storage.<br/>
2. As you can see all the fields needs to filled in valid order and they are also getting the object (fields value).<br/>
3. In local storage we hve USER name storage all the fields getting stored in it as we holding user credentials.<br/>
4. And restricted the user acess the page widout the account,if user didnt register themselves the detail page will,
popup the message on accessing them to user first register yourself.<br/>
5. Then on clicking on the register button page will route the user to sign up then to sign in them to detail page.<br/>
6. After successfully entering the valid fields. On clicking on the logout button on details page the user credentials will be remove from the local storage and the page navigate the user to sign up page.
